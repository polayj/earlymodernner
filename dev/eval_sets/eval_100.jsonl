As\nto the Executive Part of the Prince's Power, he exercises\nit by Ministers and Officers, not only sworn, but severely\naccomptable : And though both He and the Lords have their\nNegatives in passing of Bills, and it be the King only, that\nby his Royal Fiat, makes our Laws; yet no Tax being imposable\nbut by the consent of the Commons, nor any Law\n(without it) of such validity, that the Ministers of Justice\nwill enforce it, there is a wise and sweet necessity for the King,\nand likewise for the Lords, to pass all such Bills as are convenient\nfor the People, and not greatly hurtful to the Prince.\nAnd those that duly weigh the Reason of things, do find a\nNegative in the King to be a most safe preservative of Peace\nto the People, who have as much comfort under the protection\nof his Prerogative, as they have Benefit by their\nown Privileges ; For in truth, this Bug-bear Negative (as\nour Republicans labour to represent it) is an impenetrable\nTarget, to shelter and secure the Government from being\nalter'd at the Will of the Commons, if at any time they\nshould again prove factious. This (being in reason manifest)\nhas also been confirm'd by great Experience; our\nKings having rarely obstructed any Bill which they might\nsafely grant; but on the other side, pass'd many High Acts\nof meer Grace; circumscribing their Prerogative, and\nclipping its Wings; nay better had it been for us, if they\nhad not pierc'd,its very Bowels.\nThis is that triple-Cord that could never yet be broken,\nthough it has been Cut asunder; This is our Gold seventimes\nRefin'd; for every Bill, being thrice Read, Debated, and\nAgreed\n[19]\nAgreed in Either House, is at last brought to the King for\nhis Royal Assent; (which is the Mint of our Laws:) a\nTryal so exact, that surely no Dross can escape it; since\nall Interests must thereto concur; as truly it is but fit they\nshould, in the Establishment of That which must Bind all.\nThis is that Temperament, which purges our Humors, and\n(at once) endues us with Health, Vigour, and Beauty: No\nVote is here precipitated; no Act huddled up; as by sad\nEvents, you saw they formerly us'd to be, when the Power\nwas engrossed by a pretended House of Commons, purg’d\nand moulded to the Interests of a Faction; a Consequence\nbut Natural to such Premises! Nothing was (there) weigh'd,\nbut as in a Ballance consisting of one Scale; our Laws\nwere Mandrakes of a Night's Growth; and our Times as\nFickle as the Weather of the Multitude.\nThe King has the Power of making War, but then he\ncannot well be said to have the Means; so that it does not\namount to extraordinary much more, than a Liberty to\nFly if he can get Wings. He has a Sword also; but Himself\nalone very rarely draws it: And though he has the sole\nright in the Militia, yet is he pleased to wear it only as\na decent Weapon; Vouchsafing to the Nation, in a large\nDegree, the Use and Benefit of it.

I\nquestion not but there are many Petty-factors at Port\nRoyal, who have stated their Accounts, and\nballanced their Books with the sole Answer of an\nEarthquake, whose Interest therefore it is to\nrepresent it in the most dreadful manner possible,\nthat they themselves may seem the more excuse\nable to their Employers, as if the whole Island were\ndestroyed thereby, which will discourage Merchants\nfrom Trafficking hither, and will be a means of\nfurther suffering thereby. Yet as I have done my\nbest to give you a true Information hitherto, so I\ncan assure you of the Truth of what I farther\nassert, That by the Blessing of God having hitherto\nreasonable good Weather, the Planters continue\nemploy'd in making of Goods, Cottons, and Indigo's,\n&c. providing them for a Market; and such who\nhave Sugar works, which is the staple of the Island,\nmany of them had Timber buildings, which are\neither little or not at all prejudiced; and others who\nbuilt with Brick, or Stone, have so much time\nbetween this and Crop-time, that they can, and\ndoubtless will fit themselves in some measure in\norder to it: So that I am sufficiently convinced, and\ntherefore would persuade any other, that whosoever\nTrades hither for any manner of Goods for\nCloathing, Houshold-stuff, Arms and Ammunition,\n(which are generally spoiled) all manner of\nProvisions, Plantation Utensils, &c. will come by\nso much to the better Market, by how much they\nhasten\n[11]\nhasten to our Assistance, and need never fear the\nfreighting of their Ships homeward, there being a\npresent damp upon Trade, which I don’t know how\nlong it may continue, so that we shall have great\nquantities of Goods ready for them, to dispatch them\nthe sooner away. God in his Displeasure remembred\nMercy, and therefore this Calamity happened\nin the Day-time, to the safety of many hundred\nSouls; for though such numbers perisht at Port\nRoyal, where they were thronged together in an\nIstmus of Land, yet I cannot hear of fifty Persons,\nboth White and Blacks, that perished throughout\nall the Island beside. — And though in the midst of\nour distress it pleas'd God to give us a signal\nVictory over our Enemies, the French, who happened\nat that time to make the sharpest Attack upon us\nsince the War, having landed some say 200, some\nsay 80 Men at the North-side, which is but weakly\nfurnished with Men, where they intrench'd\nthemselves, but were shamefully beaten out by a vigorous\nOn-set in the Night, by a Party of about thirty\nMen, who slew 7 or 8 outright, and the rest flying\nto their Boats were 30 of them drowned, while\nin the mean time our Fleet which was set out on\npurpose pursuing theirs, we took one Shalop, and\nmade them desperately blow up their great Ship\nsuch as were saved remaining our Prisoners, and\nothers fled home to give an Account of their Over\nthrow.

The first\ncause of its rise was from the Indiscretion of the Portuguese, who\npresuming upon their being Masters of the Sugar- Trade in the\nBrasills, laid a heavy Tax on their own Sugar, which encourag'd\nour Island of Barbadoes, to whom first the way of making of Sugar\nwas discover'd, to run into the Trade; and it has been in vain that\nthe Portuguese saw their Error, and have since endeavour'd to retrieve\nit. This is so direct an Example, 'tis needless to argue it.\nAnd whoever knows the Sugar- Trade, cannot be ignorant, that it\nis not impossible to be lost by the same Error by which it was\ngain'd.\nIn the Reign of the late King James an additional Duty was\nlaid upon Sugar, notwithstanding all the Remonstrances of the\nTraders and Planters to the contrary; and yet even then nothing\nbut the pretence that the Duty wou'd not affect the Planters but lye\non the Consumer, with a Promise of His Majesty to remit it if it\nprov'd otherwise, could make it seem tolerable.\nBut when time demonstrated the sad effect it had on the Planter,\nand they applied for Relief, they were answer'd, 'Twas an Unmannerly\nthing to put His Majesty in mind of His Promise.\n'Tis true, if sugar was Planted and Cur'd in England, the Duty\nmight lye on the Consumer, as in other Cases it does; but here the\nCase differs exceedingly.\nThe Planter is the Seller at our Market, the Merchant here is but\nthe Factor; when the Planter Ships his Sugars for England he consigns\nthem to his Factor to be Sold for him, and generally draws\nBills upon his Factor for as much as he supposes the Produce to be,\nand sometimes more.\nUpon laying the Duty abovementioned, the Experiment was made;\nthe Factor had two ways to manage the Sugars and Bills, and no\nmore.\n1. To\n(3)\n1. To Accept the Bills absolutely. Or,\n2. Conditionally.\nIf he accepted the Bills absolutely, he would then sell the Goods\nat the Market-price, let it be what it would, to enable him to\ncomply with the Payment; and if the Produce did not make it\ngood, the Planter remain'd Debtor to the Ballance, so the Loss\nreturn'd upon him.\nIf he accepted the Bills conditionally, that is, to pay when the\nGoods are sold: If the Goods did not sell in time, the Bills went\nback protested, or else were Noted, and lay here at Interest and\nCharges. By both which the Planter was a considerable Loser both\nin Money and Reputation.\nThe Buyers here knowing too well these Methods of their Trade,\nand that of Necessity the Factor must sell for the Reasons aforesaid,\nrefused to advance in Price notwithstanding the Duty, and withheld\nbuying by a General Consent, and the Consequence soon\nanswer'd their Expectation, for the factors were forced to sell at the\nold Price to support the Credit both of themselves and their Principals.\n\nBut some of the most Considerable Factors being willing to try\nall possible Ways for their Employers, shipp'd off great Quantities\nfor Holland, Hambourgh, and other Parts, but those Markets\nbeing not able to take off the Quantities, and the Bills still following\nthe Goods, to enable the Exporter to pay the Planters Bills, as\nabove, the very same thing follow'd Abroad, the Goods were\nforced to be sold to raise the Money, and the Loss fell still upon\nthe poor Planter.\nThus, whoever pays the Money, the Planter bears the Loss, and\nis left in Debt, and consequently Undone; for 'tis quite another\nthing to be in Debt in the West Indies than 'tis in England.\nThat the Planter is not able to bear the Duty, at least, at this\ntime, is the next thing to be proved, and that is as plain as the\nother. The War which has lasted now nine Years, has been a\nGeneral Prejudice to all Trade, but to the West-India Trade in\nparticular: And in the West Indies, the Islands of Barbadoes and\nJamaica have been as it were destin'd to be Ruin'd, having besides\nthe War had a Complication of Disasters, as the dreadful Earthquake,\nand the Insurrection of the Negroes at Jamaica, the Loss of\nThree or Four entire Fleets from Barbadoes, by Disaster of Weather\nand Hurricanes, together with a Distemper brought amongst them\nby the Men of War, little better than the Plague, which sweet\naway great Numbers of their Inhabitants,\nAlso they have raised Forces, and fitted out Ships at their own\nCharge for several Expeditions; and in short, besides their Losses\nat Sea by the French, with the Ruin of great part of Jamaica,\nand St. Christophers, by their Descents, have raised larger Taxes on\ntheir Estates than has been paid by us at home; by which Means\nthere is not half the Sugar planted in the West-Indies that was before\nthe War.\nAfter", "entities": []}

There might possibly\nhave been some need of their presumption, had\nall Mankind been indow'd with as little Sense and\nHonesty as H—s and his Suborners; for no\nother Body could ever presume it to mean any thing\nelse, since our Acts do not oblige England: tho if\nthey had presum'd that our Enemies would take\ncare than the said Promise should not be kept, the\nrefusal of lending our Company the 3 Men of War\nbuilt at the Charge of our own Nation, would\nsoon have convinc'd the World that they had\npresum'd too true.\nWe have accounted for rejecting Mr. Douglas'\nProposal elsewhere; nor shall we take notice of\nH—s's scurrilous Reflections on Mr. Paterson\nwhich\n( 53 )\nwhich only discover his own Temper, but do that\nhonest Man no hurt. As to his charging us with\nsquandring away 50000 l. on 6 Hulks at Amsterdam\nand Hamburgh, purely to make a noise of our Procedings,\n&c. we would desire him and his Suborners\nto reconcile it with what they say from p. 14, to\n20. where they own themselves that the Dutch and\nHamburgers were both mightily pleas'd with the\nDesign, p. 14. That the Dutch were tickled with the\nConceit that they should be Sharers in the Scots Trade ;\nand p.16. they say, That that which gave the dead stroke\nto the Scots Design, was the East and West-India\nCompanies running open mouth'd to the Lords of Amsterdam,\nshewing what was hatching by the Scots Commissioners\nin their City to ruine the Trade of the United\nProvinces. P. 17. they tell us, That the Hamburgers\nthought it the more their Interest to embrace\nthe Project, the more that the Dutch oppos'd it: P.18. That\nour Affair was generally favour'd by the Burgers of\nHamburg; and p. 21. That the Government of England\nsent the Senate of Hamburgh a Caution by Sir Paul\nRicaut to take care how they suffer'd their Burghers\nto embark with us. So that here we condemn\nthem from their own months: It being plain from\nthose Concessions, that we did not idly squander\naway our Money at Hamburgh and Amsterdam; but\nthat both those trading Cities approv'd our Design,\nand would have engag'd in it, had not the Court of\nEngland and the Dutch oppos'd it; and therefore\nwhat loss of Mony we sustain'd in those places,\nmust be charg'd to their Account; so that H—s\nhath verified the Proverb, That Liars have need\nof good Memories.\nThis is not the only Instance wherein those of\nH—s and his Suborners have giv'n them the\nslip; for in the 4th page of the Dedication, they\nupbraid\nE 3", "entities": []}

They will buy the Woollen, and other English Manufactures, proper for\nGuiny, at their own Rates, having no Competitors, and will sell all the Commodities\nthey import from thence into England, at what Prises they please.\nII. In such Case they alone can carry such Negroes to the West-Indies as are fit\nfor the English Plantations, which are only to be purchased between Cape Blanco\nand Cape Lopez, and so will make their own Prizes for them, and Impose what\nTerms they please on the Planters, as heretofore the African Company have done:\nand by buying Negroes dear, less of the West-India Commodities have been, and\nwill be produced, and at greater Charge; whereby other Nations have already\nhad an Opportunity, and have too well made use of it, to Vye with us in those\nCommodities; to the great Abatement of the Advantage of this Kingdom; and\nit may prove the Ruine of our Colonies: For if the Company have produced such\nMischiefs by the Authority of a Charter only, What may be expected from them,\nif they should be established by a Law?\nIII. Such a Company having no Competitors, will buy as Cheap, and sell as\nDear as they please; and so will get as much by One Thousand Pounds, as would\nbe good Profit to Private Persons trading with Three times as much; and therefore\nit is not their Interest to enlarge the Trade, but to get as much as they can by\nthe small Stock they employ; whereas many Buyers would Enhance the Price of\nEnglish Manufactures at home, and occasion a great Exportation of them, and\nlower the Price of Forreign Goods in England, and bring Negroes much cheaper to\nthe Plantations, and thereby the Trade would greatly Increase.\nAnd though the Company now offer to content themselves to be limited from Cape Blanco\nto Cape Lopez, and to leave out Angola, yet that does not at all help the matter, for\nthese Reasons:\n1. It is humbly conceived, That all the Subjects of England have an Equal Right\nto all parts of the Guiny Trade.\n2. The Extent of the Coast between Cape Blanco and Cape Lopez, is about\n3000 Miles, besides up the Rivers in the Inland Country; and includes the whole\nTrade for Gold, Teeth, Dying Wood, and for such Negroes as are fit for, and desired\nat the English Plantations: For although there are Negroes to be had at Angola,\nand such as the Spaniards like, yet the English will not buy them, unless a\nfew for their House Service; they being a lazy sort of Negro, and very rebellious:\nAnd the safety of the Plantations depends upon having Negroes from all parts of\nGuiny, who no: understanding each others languages and Customs, do not, and cannot\nagree to Rebel, as they would do, and has by sad Experience been found, when\nthere are too many Negroes from one Country.\n3.

And those very Persons, who have\nthought themselves most interested in the Event of this Bill, are no more Englishmen, than any\nConstantinople Jew may be at any Time by Denization.\nIt is known to all who have lived at Aleppo, that the Leghorn Jews, who live there under\nFrench Protection, wear their Beards, and live and converse altogether with the Jews of the\nPlace, with whom they intermarry. The chief Partner of the Jew at Smyrna, who has been\ncited in a late Case, does the same at Smyrna; and it is known, that they all contribute, in\nsome Form or other, either by a Rate or free Gift, to the Maintenance of the national Poor;\nwhich is a heavy Charge, and many of them have been heard to complain of it as such.\nSeveral of the Jews now living at Constantinople, and elsewhere, are descended from such as\ncame from Italy under some foreign Protection ; but, mixing there with their own People, the next\nGeneration of them became Subjects of the Sultan: The same thing will no doubt happen with\nthe English Jews; and as to such of them as may not marry, there are not wanting Inducements\nto their considering themselves as at Home in Turkey.\nThe Protection given to stranger Jews, by the Christian Ambassadors in Turkey, is very different\nfrom what the English Jews are to have from this Bill; for those stranger Jews are not\nconsidered as the Subjects of any one of the States by whom they are protected, but as Subjects\nof States not in Amity with the Porte, and who are allowed to resort to Turkey, under\nthe Protection of some one of the Nations established there: But they are not received into the\nCommunity of any of the Nations they are under, or have a Place at their national Assemblies;\nnor can those who are protected by France, who are the greater Number, trade to or from\nFrance; and, in case of any Difficulties, they are to be helped out at their own particular\nExpence; they pay their Consulage, and are exempted from being treated as Subjects of the\nCountry; and even in this, their Pretensions are to be treated with great Moderation.\nThe Turks allow the Protection of their own Subjects by foreign Ambassadors, with the\nCommission of an Honorary Druggoman in the same Manner; and a Vizier, or other great\nMinister, will often ask this as a Favour, in Behalf of a Jew or Christian they may be disposed\nto favour.\nThe other Reason against admitting the Jews into the Levant Company, is, that they will in\ntime get all the Trade into their own Hands; but this is the least Inconveniency that can happen\nby this proposed Regulations: This Apprehension is founded solely on the Preference they will have\nfrom their Brethren in Turkey: The large Communities of Jews there, have a great Influence, which\nwill be employed in favour of their Brethren against the King's Christian Subjects; and it must\nand will bear them down in the End. They are not afraid of the Skill or Industry of the Jews;\nthose are in every Man, as God has given him Talents, and he has employed them: Nor are they\napprehensive the Jews, by their Oeconomy, can go cheaper to Market than they; for they have\nseen as many Instances of Vanity and Excess in Turkey, amongst them, as amongst any other Set\nof People; and their national Expences there must be great. There have, indeed, been Suggestions\nthat they could do Business for less Commission: But this is an Abuse; and there was\nlately a very flagrant Instance at Constantinople, of a Jew House, which had pretended to mighty\nMatters of this kind ; and a great Circulation was carried on for some time, but all ended in a\nscandalous Failure; the two partners disappeared; some of the Creditors upon the Place got somewhat\nin a sort of Scramble, but for the foreign Correspondents, who were chiefly at Venice and\nHolland, there was not any thing left. What, therefore, the King's Christian Subjects hope for,\nis, that they shall not, by this Bill, be put within the Reach of a most undue Influence and Preference;\nwhich must be the Case, if the Jews come at all into this Trade.", "entities": []}

This is no other than the common clayed sugar rasped\nvery fine before drying, and rammed into small moulds which have been previously\nmoistened with water. This sort of sugar looks very beautiful: but as\nits particles have no natural union, they separate upon the least moisture, and\nrun into melasses.\n3. Of Sugar-Candy.\nSugar-candy is made from the muscavado or clayed sugar, by dissolving\nthem in weak lime water, and after due clarification setting them to\ncrystalize or shoot in a hot room. The moulds are furnished with a number of\nsmall sticks laid across for the sugar to shoot upon: their lower apperture is almost\nclosed, so as to suffer the part which remains liquid to filter through very slowly.\nWhen the sugar is sufficiently boiled, it is carried with all possible expedition\ninto an hot stove, immediately poured into the moulds, and the stove kept strongly\nheated. The sugar concretes upon the stick into crystalline masses, of a white or\nbrown colour, according as the sugar was pure or impure.\nAPPENDIX.\nThe Art of fermenting and distilling Melasses, &c. for RUM,\nor inflammable Spirit.\n1. Of the Fermentation of the Cane Juice in general.\nAll kinds of sweet vegetable juices are capable of being converted, by means of\nslow fermentation, into vinous liquors, which may either be preserved in that\nform, or made to yield by distillation an inflammable spirit; by a hasty fermentation,\nor a slow one long continued, they are changed into vinegars. The native\njuice of the sugar cane, as it is eminently sweet, is likewise in a particular manner\ndisposed to ferment; but without a great deal of address runs, beyond the process\nof vinous fermentation, into an acetous state. After it has undergone a degree of\nfire, it becomes less susceptible of these changes; and does not ferment readily\nwithout the assistance of such matters as promote this operation: such is the flower\nor head which arises upon liquors during fermentation, &c.\nHere", "entities": []}

Their\nLeaves are many of them dead, and most discolour'd, unless\non very young Trees. They are not at all beautiful, nor so agreeable\nto the Eye, as the Fruit is to the Palate of them that\nlove Chocolatto. The number of Codds the Tree produces,\nis uncertain: But we reckon, a bearing Tree yields from 2\nto 8 pound of nuts a year; and each Codd contains from 20 to\n30 nuts.\nThe Manner of Curing them is; to cut them down when\nthey are ripe, and to lay them to sweat 3 or 4 dayes in the\nCodds; which is done by laying them on heaps. After this\nthey cut the codds, and take out the nuts, and put them into\na trough cover'd with plantan-leaves, where they sweat again\nabout 16 or 20 days. The nuts that are in each codd, are knit\ntogether by certain fibres, and have about them a white kind\nof pulp, that's agreeable to the palate. By the turning and\nswetting their little strings are broken, and the pulp is imbibed\nand mingled with the substance of the nut. After this, they\nare put to dry 3 or 4 weeks in the Sun, and then they\nbecome of a reddish dark colour, as you see, and so are\ncured.\nWhat is remarkable in this fruit is, that the Codds grow only\nout of the Body or great Limbs and boughs; and that at\nthe same time, and in the same place, there are blossoms, young\nand ripe fruit.\nThese Trees bear at different times; the greatest crop, at most\nof our Cacao walks is in December and January: But at one\nof Colonel Modifords walks, whence this Tree was taken, they\nbear most in May; yet its not above 5 miles from those walks,\nwhich bear alwaies in December: But those that bear\nthen, have some fruit in May; as the other have in December.\nIt's planted first in the Nut, alwaies under shade: Some do\nit under Cassive; others, under Plantan-tree, and some in the\nWoods.

Supposing\ntheir Assertion to be true, this can be no Argument against the\nprohibiting their Manufactures to be worn in England, and our Plantations,\nbut rather an Argument for it; for what is consumed at Home,\nbrings in no Bullion; and if none be consumed at Home, more may\nbe sent Abroad: for it will make the Company more industrious to find\nout either New Commodities to deal in, or Markets for the vending\nthereof, whereby they may make their Trade more Profitable to the\nNation.\nIt is also alledged, in favour of the East-India Trade, That there have\nof late years been great Quantities of English Cloth Exported by the Company.\nTo which this Answer is to be given, That the Cloth by them Exported\nmore than formerly, is not consumed in India, but sent thence to Persia;\nwhich hinders the Turkey Merchants, who formerly used to supply those\nMarkets. So that the East-India Company sending away our Cloth,\nproves no Advantage to us, and is only done to gain a good Opinion, and\nmake the Nation believe that their Trade is not so prejudicial to us as has\nbeen represented, or as in reality it is.\nThat the sending our Money to the East-Indies, to purchase Goods\nperfectly Manufactured there, may Advance Lands, Enrich the People\nEmploy the Poor in India: But such as are spent here, in the room of\nour own Manufactures, must have the quite contrary effect with us.\nWhether it be for the Interest of England, to Settle the East-India\nTrade, without Restrictions, is humbly submitted to the Consideration of\nthe Parliament.", "entities": []}

The proclamation had restricted the delinquents to such\nfees alone, \"as had been established on proper authority.\" But\nthey had no authority whatever, except their own will and pleasure,\nfor establishing their exorbitancies; these were even founded\nneither on usage nor prescription; for I have shewn, that they\nhad not existed above twenty-one years.

Had this then any colour in it of legal usage? The only\nproper authority, on which their just fees could be established, was\nsome known law: the law of 1711, which regulated and declared\ntheir fees, was this proper authority; there existed no other law\nfor the purpose. With respect then to Jamaica, it follows, that,\nby the very terms of the proclamation, they were tied down to demand\nand take no other fees than what that law allowed them. Is\nit not strange, therefore, that, in less than a twelvemonth following\nthis positive injunction, the opinion and judgement of things should,\nupon an interested misrepresentation, be so totally changed and perverted,\nas to suspend the effects of the proclamation; to concur-\nwith the parties in deeming the law obsolete; and, further, even to\nratify such exactions, intemperate as they were beyond all bounds\"\nmoving from their offices, and directing the attorney-general to prosecute, all such officers, or\n\" their deputies, as should take or receive other than their legal fees.\" In July, 1763, his excellency\ninformed the attorney-general, \"that he must not proceed to trial of the informations\n\" against the public officers, as a copy of the report of the lords of trade and plantations, to the\n\" lords committee of the privy-council, was come to his hands; and that he daily expected, in con\"\nsequence thereof, an order from the king in council to himself, to put a stop to the prosecutions.\"\nNot long after this, the attorney-general received an official letter from his excellency, commanding\nhim \" to enter noli prosequi on all the informations; his majesty's order in council for\n\" that purpose being then arrived.\"\nof", "entities": []}

Aristobulus writeth, that he saw two of these Brachmanes, the one an old\nman shaven, the other yong with long haire, which sometimes resorted to the Marketplace,\nand were honored as Counsellors, and freely tooke what they pleased, of any\nthing there to be sold, for their sustenance. They were annointed with Sesamine oyle,\nwherewith, and with hony, they tempered their bread. They were admitted to Alexanders\ntable, where they gave lessons of patience 1: and after going to a place not far\noff, the old man lying downe with his face upward, sustained the Sunne and showers\nterrible violence. The yonger standing on one foot, held in both his hands a peece of\nwood of three cubits lifted up, and shifted feete, as the other was wearie: and so they\ncontinued every day. The yong man returned home afterward, but the old man followed\nthe King, with whom he changed his habit and life, for which, when as he was\nby some reproved, he answered that he had fulfilled the fortie yeares exercise, which\nhe had vowed. Onesicritus saith, that Alexander, hearing of some religious Observants,\nwhich went naked, and exercised themselves to much hardship, and would m not come\nto others, but would bid men, if they would have any thing with them, to come to\nthem; sent him unto them, who found fifteene of them twentie furlongs from the\nCitie, each of them obseruing his owne gesture of sitting, standing, or lying naked, and\nnot stirring till Sun-setting, in that unsupportable heate, at which time they returned\ninto the Citie. Calanus was one of them. He afterward followed Alexander into Persia,\nwhere beginning to be sicke, he caused a great pile or frame of wood to be made,\nwherein he placed himselfe in a golden chaire, and caused fire to be put to, in which he\nwas voluntarily consumed, telling (if they tell true) that he would meet Alexander at\nBabylon, the place fatall to Alexanders death. AElianus n faith, that this was done\nin a suburb of Babylon, and that the fire was of Cedar, Cypresse, Mirtle, Laurell, and\nother sweet woods: and after he had performed his daily exercise of running, he placed\nhimselfe in the middest, crowned with the leaves of reedes, the Sunne shining on\nhim, which he worshipped. This adoration was the signe which he gave to the Macedonians\nto kindle the fire, in which he abode without any stirring till he was dead;\nAlexander himselfe admiring, and preferring this victory of Calanus before all his\nowne. This Calanus told Onefieritus of a golden world, where meale was as plentifull\nas dust, and fountaines streamed milke, hony, wine and oyle. Which Countrey, by\nmen turned into wantonnesse, Iupiter altered and detained, imposing a life of hardnesse\nand labour, which while men followed, they enioyed abundance; but now that men\nbegin to surfet and grow disobedient, there is danger of universall destruction. When\nhe had thus spoken, he bade him, if he would heare further, strip himselfe, and lye naked\nupon these stones. But Mandanis, 9 another of them, reproved Calanus for his\nharshnes, and, commending Alexander for his love to learning, faid that they inured\ntheir bodies to labour for the confirmation of their minds against passions.

After\nwhich, you must cause one presently to poure\ntwo or three gallons of cold fountaine water\nupon your head. Then let your head be dryed\nwith cold towels. Which sodaine pouring\ndowne of cold water, although it doth mightily\nterrifie you, yet nevertheles, it is very good,\nfor therby the naturall heate is stirred within\nthe body, baldnesse is kept backe, and the memory\nis quickned. In like manner, washing\nof hands often, doth much availe the eyesight.\nHow shall a man bathe himselfe in Winter time\nwhen waters be frozen?\nIn Winter time this kinde of artificiall bathing\nis very expedient and wholsome: Take\ntwo pound of Turpentine, foure ounces of the\niuyce of Wormwood and wild mallowes, one\nounce\nF 4", "entities": []}

The whole is firm, decisive,\nand consistent; exhibiting a strong disposition\nto cultivate peace, without disparagement\nto the national character and safety.
