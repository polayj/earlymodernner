Inconveniences will arise\nfrom Frosts in this scheme, as admitted in my\nobservations on the other. But the Dock proposed\nwill affect the navigable part of the\nthe Frome only, leaving the Avon open to the\ntide; and why should we be at so heavy an\nexpence to deprive ourselves of the advantage",
