the sad and dismal Story\nBrought from off the Lizzard Rocks,\nThe Royal Anne in all her Glory,\nThere receiv’d a fatal shock:\nThe Winds and Waves did both conspire,\nFor to ruin all therein:\nOh Belhaven! brave Belhaven!\nMost unhappy hast thou been.\nGovernor unto Barbadoes,\nHe was sailing bold and brave',\nLittle dreaming it was his Fortune,\nFor to have a watry Grave\nWith many more brave noble Persons,\nWhich were put in Place of Trust,\nBut oh! their Sands were just expiring\nTheir Time was come and die they must.\nAbove two hundred Souls were perish'd,\nIn an Instant all were lost\nBy furious Winds and Waves were driven,\nOn the Stag Rocks they were cast;\nWhen the Galley split to Pieces,\nFor to hear their pitious Moan.\nOf all that were on board the Vessel,\nOnly three could reach the Shore,\nWho on a Wreck by the Winds were carried,\nThro' the Waves and Billows, roar:\nThen praise the Lord for his great Mercy\nYou that thus have been preserv'd\nAdore and magnifie his Goodness,\nWillingly your Maker serve.\nCaptain Willis was Commander,\nAt this most unhappy Time,\nSavage to be Attorney General\nWith many more just in their Prime,\nWhere going over for to settle,\nAt Barbadoes we do hear.\nBut by the Ocean they were follow'd,\nAs they did their Courses steer.\nWhat a Scene of dismal horror,\nThere was seen when this was o're,\nBodies floating on the Ocean.\nBy the Waves were drove on Shore,\nAnd the Country People running,\nStriving who should get the most,\nStripping all without Distinction,\nTis the Custom of the Coast.\nOne Gentleman was drove on Shore,\n'Bout whom they found a thousand Pound,\nWhose Name's supposed to be Crosier,\nBy Writings in his Pockets found:\nLikewise they say the Lord Belhaven,\nHaving on a Diamond Ring,\nHis Shirt mark'd B. the floating Ocean,\nDid to Shore his Body bring.\nOh! the grief and sad Distraction,\nWhich this Accident hath brought,\nOn the Wives and near Relations,\nOf the Persons that are lost;\nSome for Husbands, other Fathers,\nBrothers, Kinsmen, do lament,\nWith aking Hearts, and weeping Eyes,\nTo think how from them they are rent.\nBut now observe the dismal Story,\nGiven by these three that's sav'd,\nGeorge Hain, likewise William Godfrey,\nAnd Thomas Laurence, a Boy 'tis said,\nAs to Barbadoes we were sailing,\nLord Belhaven, he did say,\nCome noble Boys and jovial Sailors,\nHappy may our Voyage be\nBut drawing near unto the Lizzard,\nThere the Storm began to rise,\nNothing then but Desolation,\nDid appear before our eyes,\nSuch a dreadful Scene of Sorrow,\nSure before was never seen,\nOh Belhaven! brave Belhaven!\nMost unhappy hast thou been.\nCaptain Willis cry'd brave Sailors,\nDo your best, or die we must,\nLord have Mercy, now relieve us,\nIn thy Providence we trust.\nSave us in the Time of Danger,\nFor Death before our Eyes appear,\nAnd when they found all Hope were over,\nIn Tears they all fell down to Prayer.\nThen against the fatal Rocks,\nThe Royal Galley split in twain,\nTwo hundred Souls aloud were crying,\nLord save us from the watry Main,\nTo see each for his Life a shifting,\nAs the Waves tost Mountains high,\nThe Galley in the Deep a sinking,\nWhile dying Groans did pierce the Sky.\nI see the Noble Lord Belhaven,\nClimbing to the Top-Mast high,\nWith many more of Birth and Breeding,\nWho likewise in the Waves did die,\nAt length the Galley split in Pieces,\nDeath put an End to all their Woe,\nWe three poor Souls upon a Wreck,\nWith Waves was tossed too and fro.\nAt length unto the Shore was driven,\nWhere the People took us in;\nWe prais'd the Lord for his great Mercy,\nSince we thus preserv'd have been,\nAnd sav'd us in the fatal Hour,\nWhen the Waves did us surround,\nAnd a many Souls did perish,\nAnd before our Eyes were drown'd.\nOh! the dreadful Grief and Sorrow,\nThat their Wives and Children bear,\nWives a keeping for their Husbands,\nThe Children for their Father dear,\nLet each tender Heart implore them,\nAnd pity the Sorrow they are in,\nAnd think upon the Lord Belhaven,\nHow unhappy he has been.\nA noble Lady in the City,\nHearing of her Husband's Death,\nTwould have mov'd a Heart of Pity,\nTo hear the Words she did express,\nCrying, O my tender Jewel,\nIs a watry Wave thy Tomb,\nI'll search the Deep to find my Dear,\nO cruel Death come seize me soon.\nThus she raves in sad Distraction,\nIn her Bed with Cords she's bound,\nCrying Night and Day my Jewel,\nHe is in the Ocean drown’d:\nThus many a mournful Widow,\nAnd Babies Fatherless are made,\nConsider then the many Dangers,\nWhich poor Sailors thro’ do wade.\nMany more that Night did perish,\nIn the Storm as we do hear,\nAs in the Downs the Fleet was riding,\nSome Lord Belhaven's Fate did share;\nLord keep us from all such Disaster,\nDeliver us from sudden Death,\nAnd give us Grace that we may serve,\nThe mighty God while we have Breath.",
