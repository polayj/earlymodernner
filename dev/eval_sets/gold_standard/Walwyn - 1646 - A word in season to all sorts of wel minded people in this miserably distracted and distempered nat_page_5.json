  "text": "(6)\nThis Authority, in the worst of all former\nTimes, when the strongest force and\npower was upon them ever stuck closest to\nthe intrest of the People, nor did the People\nin the worst of times, ever forsake them, but\nmaintained Their power and priviledges,\ntheir Essence and Authority, whensoever\nthey called upon them for helpe and assistance,\nnor hath this just and powerfull Authority\nbeen more true to the Commons\nthat chose them, then to those worthy\nLords and Patriots, that at any time have\nassisted them for the common good of the\nNation, preserving their Honours with as\ntrue affection as the liberties of the People;\nno man can name the time that (intentionally)\nthis Authority ever did injury to any\nJust intrest either at home or abroad, but\nhave borne and suffered much, from those\nthat have made an ill use of their lenity and\ncredulity.\nAll which is necessary to be remembered,\nand seriously considered in this instant of\ntime, because if these things be seriously laid\nto heart, it may happily expel those\npoysonous vapors, with which our ayre begins\nto be infected, wee have ageneration of\nforgetfull\n(7)\ngetfull, ingratefull people, who because the\nParliament cannot yeeld unto all they desire\n(without extreame thraldom to the people,\nin things Ecclesiasticall and Civill) are degenerate\ninto a malevolent disposition, murmuring\nand repining at all their proceedings,\nand making hard constructions of\ntheir Just endeavours; and by politique and\nsubtill meanes, labour to alinate the hearts of\ntheir friends from them, and to incline them\nto give eare to other Counsels, laying open\ntheir infirmities, (which they should rather\ngo backward to cover) and would (if they\ncould) possesse the world that there is a sort\nof men that would settle Religion more\npurely, performe and interpret the Covenant\nmore exactly, and doe justice more\nspeedily, and more sincerely then this just\nAuthority, whom the peoble themselves\nhave chosen; nay, there are fames abroad,\nthat there are catalogues taken of any thing\nthat may possibly bear a bad or sinister construction,\nto be shewed to the people, in the\nday of their extremity, if such a day can be\nprocured.\nAnd for what end all this? Why, you\nshall not faile to be told it is for the glory of\nGod.",
