It is evident, that not only those Ships, but\ntheir Cargoes belong'd to private Merchants in London,\nBristol, and Liverpool, who employ'd Factors settled in\nJamaica, and the supplying the private Traders with Negroes\nwas very beneficial to them, as well as to the Inhabitants;\nand those Factors not only employ'd a great\nNumber of People under them, but purchased the Product\nof the Island to load their Ships; and the Money\nlaid out by those Means, as well as for Stores and Necessaries,\ncirculated in the Island, and occasioned a Life and\nSpirit amongst them.\nFourthly, THAT there had been a greater private\nTrade carried on from Jamaica, since the Year 1723, than\nin eighteen Years which he had known the Island.\nHERE I am at a Loss how to take that Gentleman's\nMeaning; if he would be understood a Trade carried\non by the Merchants who reside in Jamaica, it is contrary\n",
