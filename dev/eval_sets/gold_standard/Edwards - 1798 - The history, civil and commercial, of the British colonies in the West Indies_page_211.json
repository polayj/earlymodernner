When two African states are at war, the\ncaptives are dealt with in proportion to their strength\nand appearance. The old and infirm are massacred\non the spot; such as are able to travel a long\njourney are led to the sea-coast, and of these all\nwho are rejected are immediately put to death.\nFrom this it appears, that were Britain to withdraw\nher demand, there would be left a superabundance\nof about 38,000 every year, who, unless bought up\nby other nations, must inevitably be sacrificed to\nthe disappointed avarice of the black trader. Instances,\nindeed, of this barbarous practice are so\nnumerous, that they have been frequently perpetrated\nin sight of our own shipping; so that in this\ncase the remedy becomes abundantly more horrible\nthan the disease.\nSecondly, Let an unprejudiced mind reflect upon\nthe situation of the remaining negroes, in the West\nZ ij",
