VIII.\n109\ntheir interest, succeeded so well, as to obtain the order of his majesty\nin council before-mentioned; in consequence of which, several\nactions, that had been instituted, were stopped by noli prosequi;\nand the complainants obliged to fit down unredressed; but with\nthis further agravation of hardship, that they had been entrapped,\nby the terms of the proclamation, to expend from two to three hundred\npounds each, in the vain hope of bringing the offender to\njustice. The proclamation had restricted the delinquents to such\nfees alone, \"as had been established on proper authority.\" But\nthey had no authority whatever, except their own will and pleasure,\nfor establishing their exorbitancies; these were even founded\nneither on usage nor prescription; for I have shewn, that they\nhad not existed above twenty-one years. They had originally arisen\nby trifling deviations from the act of 1711; so small at first, perhaps,\nas not to deserve opposition; or so modestly demanded, as\nnot to provoke it: at length, they grew to surpass all limits, and\nwere neither required, nor paid, without frequent altercation and\ndispute. Had this then any colour in it of legal usage? The only\nproper authority, on which their just fees could be established, was\nsome known law: the law of 1711, which regulated and declared\ntheir fees, was this proper authority; there existed no other law\nfor the purpose. With respect then to Jamaica, it follows, that,\nby the very terms of the proclamation, they were tied down to demand\nand take no other fees than what that law allowed them. Is\nit not strange, therefore, that, in less than a twelvemonth following\nthis positive injunction, the opinion and judgement of things should,\nupon an interested misrepresentation, be so totally changed and perverted,\nas to suspend the effects of the proclamation; to concur-\nwith the parties in deeming the law obsolete; and, further, even to\nratify such exactions, intemperate as they were beyond all bounds\"\nmoving from their offices, and directing the attorney-general to prosecute, all such officers, or\n\" their deputies, as should take or receive other than their legal fees.\" In July, 1763, his excellency\ninformed the attorney-general, \"that he must not proceed to trial of the informations\n\" against the public officers, as a copy of the report of the lords of trade and plantations, to the\n\" lords committee of the privy-council, was come to his hands; and that he daily expected, in con\"\nsequence thereof, an order from the king in council to himself, to put a stop to the prosecutions.\"\nNot long after this, the attorney-general received an official letter from his excellency, commanding\nhim \" to enter noli prosequi on all the informations; his majesty's order in council for\n\" that purpose being then arrived.\"\nof",
