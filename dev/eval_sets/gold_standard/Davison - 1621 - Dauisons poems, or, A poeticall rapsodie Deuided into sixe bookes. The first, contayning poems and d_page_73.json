  "text": "130\nOf Canzonets.\nBooke ll.\nAway I wast with reares by night in vaine,\nTeares, sighes by night, by day encrease this paine.\nMine eyes no eyes, but fountaines of my teares,\nMy teares no teares, but floods to moyst my heart:\nMy heart no heart, but labour of my feares,\nMy feares no feares, but feelings of my smart.\nMy smart, my feares, my heart, my teares, mine eies\nAre blinde, dride, spent, past, wasted with my cries.\nAnd yet mine eies, though blind, see cause of griefe,\nAnd yet my teares, though dride, runne downe amaine:\nAnd yet my heart, though spent, attends reliefe.\nAnd yet my feares, though past, encrease my paine.\nAnd yet I live, and living feele more smart,\nAnd smarting, cry in vaine, breake heavy heart.\nXXXII. CANZONET.\nDesires gouernment.\nWHere wit is over-ruld by will,\nAnd will is led by fond desire,\nThere reason were as good be still,\nAs speaking, kindle greater fire,\nFor where desire doth beare the sway,\nThe heart must rule, the head obay.\nWhat bootes the cunning Pilots skill,\nTo tell which way to shape their course:\nWhen\nBooke II.\nOf Canzonets.\nWhen he that steers will have his will,\nAnd drive them where he list pe force.\nSo reason shewes the truth in vaine,\nWhere fond desire as King doth raigne.\nXXXIII. CANZONET,\nLones properties.\nTWixt heat and cold, t'wixt death and life,\nI freeze and burne, I live and die:\nWhich ioyntly worke in me such strife,\nI live in death, in cold I fry.\nNor hot, nor cold, nor live, nor dead,\nNeither, and both, this life I lead.\nFirst burning heate sets all on fire,\nWhereby I seeme in flames to fry:\nThen cold despaire kils hot desire,\nThat drenched deepe, in death I lye.\nHeate driues out cold, and keepes my life,\nCold quencheth heate, no end of strife.\nThe lesse I hope to have my will,\nThe more I feele desire encrease,\nAnd as desire encreaseth still,\nDespaire to quench it doth not cease.\nSo live I as the Lampe, whose light\nOft comes, oft goes, now dim, now bright.\nLiving\nK 2",
