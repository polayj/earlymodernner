Valour with Counsel swayd\nIs good, grand Nol makes all the world afraid.\nHow many seem to bless when as they curse?\nNol cares not, so that hee have power and purse.\nHow did his Parlaments and himself agree?\nHow did his several speeches made to three\nConcur? and with his Recognition more,\nPrayes, and protests, and swears, makes up the score.\nHe\nE",
