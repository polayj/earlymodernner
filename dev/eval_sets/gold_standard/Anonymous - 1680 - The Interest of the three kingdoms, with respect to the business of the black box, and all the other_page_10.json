  "text": "[18]\nComplaint, no Publick Right their Claim, or Good their\ndemand; in all which, the least breach of Privilege is\nusually branded with Sacrilege: And though there lyes no\nAppeal to the dispersed Body of the People, (a Decision manifestly\nimpracticable in Government, and fitter indeed for\nTribunes to move, than Nations to admit) yet (Elections\nbeing so popular, and Conventions frequent) the same end\nis attained with much more safety and convenience. As\nto the Executive Part of the Prince's Power, he exercises\nit by Ministers and Officers, not only sworn, but severely\naccomptable : And though both He and the Lords have their\nNegatives in passing of Bills, and it be the King only, that\nby his Royal Fiat, makes our Laws; yet no Tax being imposable\nbut by the consent of the Commons, nor any Law\n(without it) of such validity, that the Ministers of Justice\nwill enforce it, there is a wise and sweet necessity for the King,\nand likewise for the Lords, to pass all such Bills as are convenient\nfor the People, and not greatly hurtful to the Prince.\nAnd those that duly weigh the Reason of things, do find a\nNegative in the King to be a most safe preservative of Peace\nto the People, who have as much comfort under the protection\nof his Prerogative, as they have Benefit by their\nown Privileges ; For in truth, this Bug-bear Negative (as\nour Republicans labour to represent it) is an impenetrable\nTarget, to shelter and secure the Government from being\nalter'd at the Will of the Commons, if at any time they\nshould again prove factious. This (being in reason manifest)\nhas also been confirm'd by great Experience; our\nKings having rarely obstructed any Bill which they might\nsafely grant; but on the other side, pass'd many High Acts\nof meer Grace; circumscribing their Prerogative, and\nclipping its Wings; nay better had it been for us, if they\nhad not pierc'd,its very Bowels.\nThis is that triple-Cord that could never yet be broken,\nthough it has been Cut asunder; This is our Gold seventimes\nRefin'd; for every Bill, being thrice Read, Debated, and\nAgreed\n[19]\nAgreed in Either House, is at last brought to the King for\nhis Royal Assent; (which is the Mint of our Laws:) a\nTryal so exact, that surely no Dross can escape it; since\nall Interests must thereto concur; as truly it is but fit they\nshould, in the Establishment of That which must Bind all.\nThis is that Temperament, which purges our Humors, and\n(at once) endues us with Health, Vigour, and Beauty: No\nVote is here precipitated; no Act huddled up; as by sad\nEvents, you saw they formerly us'd to be, when the Power\nwas engrossed by a pretended House of Commons, purg’d\nand moulded to the Interests of a Faction; a Consequence\nbut Natural to such Premises! Nothing was (there) weigh'd,\nbut as in a Ballance consisting of one Scale; our Laws\nwere Mandrakes of a Night's Growth; and our Times as\nFickle as the Weather of the Multitude.\nThe King has the Power of making War, but then he\ncannot well be said to have the Means; so that it does not\namount to extraordinary much more, than a Liberty to\nFly if he can get Wings. He has a Sword also; but Himself\nalone very rarely draws it: And though he has the sole\nright in the Militia, yet is he pleased to wear it only as\na decent Weapon; Vouchsafing to the Nation, in a large\nDegree, the Use and Benefit of it. He chuses his Ministers;\n(as who doth not his Servants?) but then they pass through\nsuch a Test, as none but the soundest Integrity can abide. He\ncan hinder the stroke of Justice with his Pardon, (tho' still,\nthe Jaws not being muzzled, it will Bite terribly) but then\n(on the Other side) the means of Relieving his Wants rests\nin the Commons, to Ballance his Will, and induce him to\na Correspondence with Parliaments.\nThat his Person should be Sacred, is most Needful, to\navoid Circulation of Accounts; Reasonable, since it carries\nwith it the Consent of Nations; Just, that he become not\nthe meer Butt of Faction, and Malice, and be in a worse\nCondition than the Basest of Vassals; Honourable, that the\nNakedness of Government be not daily Uncover'd; Wise,\nin\nC 2",
