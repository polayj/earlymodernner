You may as well\nstop the Tide at London-Bridge with your\nThumb, as they say, as alter the Course\nof Trade and the whole Scheme of Planting\nby this Paper-kite of yours. Human\nAffairs will take their Course, fluminis ritu,\nas Horace says, wise Men go along with\nthe Stream, and do not ridiculously try to\nturn it. All States have their Periods,\nwhich no human Care can prolong; even\nGreat-Britain it is thought tends to its\nRuin, if some strong Medicines and good\nAlteratives are not applied.\nO. To regulate and direct the Affairs of\nGreat-Britain requires more Skill than I\ncan pretend to, and suits not my small Capacity.\nBy good Luck they are in the Hands\nof good Men, Men of large Property, and\nof known Worth and Honour, and we do\nexpect that they will put Things into a new\ncourse, purge away some of our corrupt\nHumours, correct the bad Juices by a good\nwholesome Regimen, and restore Health\nand Vigour to our crazy Constitution.\nThere\n4",
