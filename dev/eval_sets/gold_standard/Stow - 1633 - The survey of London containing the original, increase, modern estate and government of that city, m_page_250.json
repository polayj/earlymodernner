Regnante magna\npestilentia, consecratum fuit hoc Coemiterium,\nin quo & infra septa praesentis\nMonasterii, sepulta fuerunt mortuorum corpora,\nplusquam quinquaginta millia,\npraeter alia multa abhinc usque ad praesens,\nquorum animabus propitietur Deus, Amen.\nBull of\nPope Clement.\nCharterhouse.\nChurchyard\nprepared\nof the\npoore\nof poore\nso to\nremaine for\never.\nIn consideration of the number of\nChristian people here buried, the said\nSir Walter Manny caused first a Chappell\nto be builded, where (for the space\nof twenty three yeares) offerings were\nmade: and it is to be noted, that above\n100000. bodies of Christian people.\nhad in that Church-yard beene buried,\nfor the said Knight had purchased that\nplace for the buriall of poore people,\nTravailers, and other that were diseased,\nto remaine for ever ; whereupon,\nan order was taken, for the avoyding\nof contention betweene the Parsons of\nChurches and that house, to wit, that\nthe bodies should bee had unto the\nChurch where they were Parishioners,\nor dyed, and after the funerall service\ndone, had to the place where they\nshould be buried.\nAnd the yeere 1371. he caused thereto\nbee founded an house of Carthusian\nMonkes, which he willed to be called\nthe Salutation, and that one of the\nMonkes should be called Prior, and he\ngave them the sayd place of 13. Acres\nand a Rod of land, with the Chappel,\nand houses there builded for their habitation.\nHe also gave them the three\nAcres of land, lying without the wals\non the North part, betwixt the lands\nof the Abbot of Westminster, and the\nlands of the Prior of Saint Iohn; which\nthree Acres being purchased, inclosed,\nand dedicated by Ralph Stratford, Bishop\nof London, as is aforeshewed, remained\ntill our time, by the name of\nPardon Church-yard, & served for burying\nof such as desperately ended their\nlives, or were executed for Felonies,\nVse for the\nFryery\nCatt.\nwho were fetched thither usually in a\nclose cart, bayled over and covered\nwith blacke, having a plaine white\ncrosse thwarting, and at the fore-end\na S. Iohns Crosse without; and within a\nBell ringing by shaking of the Cart,\nwherby the same might be heard when\nit passed, & this was called the Fryery\nCart, which belonged to S. Iohns, and\nhad the priviledge of Sanctuary.\nIn this Charter-house were the Monuments\nof the said Sir Walter Manny, and\nMargaret his wife, Marmaduke Lumley,\nLaurence Bromley, Knight, Sir Edward\nHederset, Knight, Sir William Manny,\nKnight, Dame Johan Borough, Iohn Dore,\nWant Water, Knight, Robert Olney, Esquire,\nKatharine, daughter Sir William\nBabington, Knight, Blanch, daughter to\nHugh Waterton, Katharine, wife to Iohn\nat Poot, daughter and heire to Richard\nLacie, William Rawlin, Sir John\nLenthaine, and Dame Margaret his wife.\ndaughter to John Fray, John Peake Esquire,\nWilliam Baron, and William Baron,\nEsquires, Sir Thomas Thawites Knight,\nPhilip Morgan, Bishop of Ely, 1434.\nIn the Cloystrie, Bartholomew Rede,\nKnight, Maior of London, buried 1505.\nSir John Popham, &c.\nThis Monastery, at the suppression in\nthe 29. of Henry the 8. was valued at\n642.L. 4.d. halfe penny yeerely.\nThe\nworthie\nremebrance\nof M. Thomas\nSutton\nHere now I find fit time, to commend\nto all succeding posterity, the duely deserved\npraises of that truely worthy (&\nnever to be forgotten) Gentleman, Master\nThomas Sutton, the right Phœnix of\nCharity in our times. This late dissolved\nCharter-house, by West Smithfield,\nbelonging then to the Right Honorable\nThomas Earle of Suffolke, after Lord\nTreasurer of England, is sufficiently\nknowne to bee a very large and goodly\nMansion, beautified with spacious Gardens,\nWalkes, Orchards and other\npleasures, enriched with divers dependencies\nof Lands and Tenements therto\nbelonging, and very aptly seated\nfor wholesome ayre, and many other\ncommodities. All which commodiousnesse\nof situation, and largenesse of circuit,\ngave occasion to this well-minded\nGentleman Master Sutton, to affect that\nhouse, as the onely place, whereon to\nbuild\nI have\ntruely let\ndowne all\nthis, as it\nwas delivered\nmee\nin writing\nby a Gentleman\nof\ngood\nworth and\ncredit.\nSuburbs without the Wals.\n479\nHis first\npurpose at\nHallingburies\nin Affix.\nNow hee\nintended\nto rename\nthe\nHospitall.\nThe Charter\nhouse\nmore necessary\nfor\nan Hospital,\nthan\nHallingbury\nbuild the foundation of his Religious\npurpose. For, among other his Christian\ndeterminations, hee had formerly\nintended to build an house at\nHallingbury Bouchers in Essex, to be an\nHospitall for such poore men and Children\nas he himselfe (in his life time, or future\nGovernors for the same to bee\ndeputed) should thinke fit to bee lodged\nand relieved there: Also, for a Schoole-\nmaster and Usher, to teach Children\nto reade and write, and instruct them\nin the Latine and Greeke Grammar:\nwith a Learned Divine likewise to\npreach the Word of God to them all\nand a Master beside, to governe all\nthose people belonging to that house.\nTo this blessed end and purpose, hee\nhad procured (by earnest suit) power\nby an Act of Parliament, to build such\nan Hospitall in the Towne of Hallingbury\nBouchers, and that the same should\nbe named, The Hospitall of King Iames,\nfounded in Hallingbury in the Countie\nof Essex, at the humble Petition,\nand at the onely costs and charges of\nThomas Sutton, Esquire: Appointing\nalso such Honourable, Reverend and\nWorthy persons, as by the said Act of\nParliament were nominated and appointed,\nto bee the first and instant Governors\nof the Lands, Possessions,\nGoods and Reveneues of the said\nHospitall.\nBut afterward, upon more grounded\ndeliberation, and finding this goodly\nhouse of the Charter-house, to bee much\nmore convenient for the purpose, than\nthat to be builded at Hallingbury could\nbe: hee became an earnest suiter to the\nEarle of Suffolke, to purchase that\nhouse of him, acquainting his Honor\nwith the alteration of his minde concerning\nHallingbury, and his earnest desire\nto make the Charter-house his\nHospitall. The Earle being honourably\nenclined to so godly a motion, the matter\nsustained the lesse debating between\nthem: but the price being concluded\non, the bargaine and sale was assured.\nThe summe disbursed for this purpose,\namounted to 13000, L. which was paid\ndowne in hand, before the ensealing of\nthe Conveyance.\nThen he became suiter againe to his\nMajestie, to performe all that at the\nThe first\nGovernors\nappointed\nby Letters\nPatents,\nof King\nJames his\nHospitall,\nfounded\nin the\nCharterhouse.\nCharter-house, which he had formerly\nintended at Hallingbury: whereto the\nKing readily yeelded, being graciously\naffected to so charitable a Worke, and\ngranted his Letters Patents to the same\neffect.
