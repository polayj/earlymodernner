  "text": "368\nWits Common\nPart. 2.\nAs the Æthiope cannot change his\nskin, nor the Leopard alter his hew; &\nas it is not possible to gather Grapes\nof Thornes, or Figges of Thistles: so it\nis to no purpose to force any thing to\nstrive against Nature.\nAs in tilling of the ground and\nhusbandrie, there is first chosen a firtile\nsoile, then a cunning sower, then good\nseed: even so we must compare Nature\nto the fat earth, the expert husbandman\nto the Schoolemaster, the faculties and\nsciences to the pure seeds.\nAs the fertill soile if it be never tilled\ndoth wax barren: so that which is most\nnoble by nature, is made most vile by\nnegligence.\nAs the Torch turned downeward is\nextinguished with the selfe same waxe,\nwhich was the cause of his light: so\nNature turned to unkindnesse is\nquenched by those meanes it should\nbee kindled, leaving no branch of\nlove, where is found no roote of\nhumanitie.\nNewes.\nPart. 2.\nWealth.\n369\nNewes.\nAS Cookes wish for a plentifull\nbreed of cattell, and fishers of\nfishes: so busie brained innovaters doe\nhunt after newes, and innovation in\nstates. Plut.\nAs wee set up meate from cats and\ndogges: so we must take heed, what we\nspeake before newes mongers, and insinuating\nintelligencers. idem.\nAs our bodies are more indangered\nby the Spring, & in Autume, by reason\nof change: so all noveltie doth offend\nand hurt the common-wealth.\nAs change of meate, drinke and aire\ndoth offend, albeit it be into like,\nor into better: so it is better still to\nretaine our old Princes and Magistrates,\nthen to gape for new, because all innovation\nis full of danger and disturbbance.\nAs Apion called Homer from the\ndead, for none other cause, but to know\nfrom what parentage he was descended:\nso many take great paines, and bestow\nmuch cost, onely to heare newes, and\nknow novelties. Plin. lib. 30. cap. 2.\nRe\nR 5.",
