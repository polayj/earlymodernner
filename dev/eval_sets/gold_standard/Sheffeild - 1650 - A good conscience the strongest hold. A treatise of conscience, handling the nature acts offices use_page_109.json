  "text": "184\nThe suffering, or, Passive Conscience.\nCap. 13.\nEccl. Hist.\nl. 5. cap. 1.\nSocrat. hist.\n1.3. cap.13. \nTheodoret\nlib. 3. cap. 6.\nSome were hanged, some headed, some were\nburned, some drowned, some devoured of wilde\nbeasts, some pull'd in pieces by men more savage\nthen beasts, yet they did all bear it, and\nrejoyced they suffered for Conscience, and for\nGod. Attalus and Alexander were twice\nbayted with wilde hearts, to be torn in pieces\nby them, (as Eusebius reports) Attalus escaping\nthe beasts, was reserved to other torments,\nto be burnt to death in an iron chair,\nheated red-fire-hot, yet did hee bear all.\nMacedonius, Theodulus, and Tatianus laid\nupon a Gredyron, and broiled to death; yet\ndid they bear it. Marcus Arethusius was\nstripped naked, then had his bodie all\noverdaubed with Broth, Butter, and Honey, then\nhung up in a Cage in the hot scorching Sun,\nto be eaten up with flies, and stung to death\nwith wasps, yet did he suffer all rather then\ngive one half-peny to re-edifie that Idol\nTemple in his diocess, which he had formerly\nplucked down. To be eaten up with flies,\nand stung with wasps he did account farre\nmore desirable, that he might preserve his\nConscience in Puritie and Peace, then to bee\neaten up of horrour, and stung with Hornets, if\nto preserve his life, he had delivered up his\nConscience. There were many Christians\ntogether stopt up in Lakes, or Caves artificially\nmade close, which lakes, or Ditches\nwere filled with a companie of Dormise, kept\nhungrie to gnaw and feed upon the poor\nChristians, they all the while bound hand\nand\nThe suffering, or, Passive Conscience.\n185\nCap.13.\nMag. Cent.\n4. cap. 3.\nEx\nTheodoreto.\nLatrones,\n& robusti\ncorporis viri\nejusmodi\nlacerationes\nperferre\nnequeunt,\nexclamant,\n& gemitus\nedunt;\nNostri autem\n(ut de viris taceam) pueri, & muliercule tortores suos taciti vincunt,\n& expromere illis gemisum nec ignis potest. Lact. I. 5. cap. 13.\nBut\nand foot, that they could not keep off those\nhunger-starved creatures, which were kept\nwithout meat also purposely, that they\nmight fasten upon the bodies of those godly\nmen; which lingring and miserable death\nthey under-went, yet was not their faith and\npatience at all born down, saith the Historian.\nThey chose much rather to lie in such\na Lake artificially stopt, and to be eaten up\nalive with those Vermin, their Conscience\nbeing preserved, then to yeeld up this Fort\nof Conscience for fear of any earthly\ntorments, to be eaten up while alive with guilt\nand horrour of Conscience. And when dead,\nto be bound hand and foot, and cast into an infernal\nLake of fire and brimstone, eternally\nstopt up, there to be conversant with filthy\nspirits, and to be eaten up with those hellish\nfuries.\nYea, to make an end, for it is impossible\nto mention all, Lactantius saith not onely\nthe men among the Christians, and those of\nstronger years and hearts, but even our\nwoman, and little children (saith he) have\nendured all torments, and been too hard\nfor their Tormentors; no rack, no fire could\nfetch so much as a groan from them: which\nthe stoutest Theeves and Malefactors among\ntheir Persecutors could not undergo, but\nthey would roare and crie out through impatience,\nand disabilitie to endure them.",
