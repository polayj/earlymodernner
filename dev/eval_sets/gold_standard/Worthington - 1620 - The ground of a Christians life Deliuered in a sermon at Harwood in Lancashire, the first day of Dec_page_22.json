  "text": "34\nGods word the safest guide.\nJohn. 7.7.1.\nJohn 5.19.1.\nCor. 7. 31.\nThe life of\nfaith very difficult\nto nature.\ncannot hate them, but him it hated: the reason\nfolloweth, not for iniury but for innocency,\nnot for falshood but for truth:\nhe testified that the workes thereof were\nevill.\nWhat is the cause that true pietie and\ngrounded sincerity is of so smal account,\nbut because the world of the unregenerate\nlieth in wickednes, and faith to\ncarnall affections bringeth little contentment?\nHow can it be that oppressours\nextortioners, usurers, these idolatrous\nworldlings, together with thousands of\ndelicious prodigals, should entertaine\nthe Gospell: since Zaccheus must divide\nhis goods, Mathew must bid farewell to\nhis place of customary receipt; yea the\npeople of God must use this world as if\nthey used it not? How hard therefore will\nit be for such as trust in uncertaine riches,\nto subiect themselves to this life of\nfaith? May not Gods Ministers take up a\nlamentation, What happy tidings from\nthe word of faith which we preach? how\nis the way to everlasting blisse plainly\nbeaten foorth, yet how few delight to\nwalke in it? How sluggish are our common\nprofessours, that cannot watch one\nhoure?\nGods word the safest guide.\n35\nOld naturall\nmen are very\nmiserable, for\nthey are full\nof sinnes.\nhoure? and how faithlesse are those backsliding\nhypocrites, as if the unchangeable\npoffessour of heaven and earth were\nunfaithfull, or unable to recompence and\nfully reward his faithfull peoples?\nThus we see, that streight is the way,\nand small is the number that go it. Ephraim\nis an unruly heifer that will not\nbe tamed. Ever have Gods Saints bene\nlike the shaking of an olive after the vintage.\nWicked men are mad men, they\nwill not be ordered; they are deafe men,\nthey will not heare, charme the Charmer\nnever so wisely. If that he sinne\nwhich is not done of faith, how wofull\nwill it be with the greatest number, who\nneither know nor beleeve, being blinde\nand dissolute: having from their nonage\nto their old age wandred from the waies\nof God, being seven fold more the children\nof hell then they were in their mothers\nwombes? If all actions that want\nfaith be sins, how many are the sins of\nthose who were never enlightened with\nthe knowledge of God? My text hath\ndriven me into such a narrow streight, &\nso paled me in, that I cannot get liberty,\neither to licence the novelties of the Athenians,",
