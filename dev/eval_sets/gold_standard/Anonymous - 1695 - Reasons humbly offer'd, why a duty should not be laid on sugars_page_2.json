  "text": "( 2 )\nour own People in England, and pay Three times the Price for it; they\nmake the return of all their Industry and Labour to us; this is the\nCenter of their Wealth, the Place where they lay it up, and where\ntheir posterity spend it; therefore to Burthen them, is to Ruin the\nmost Profitable and most Industrious part of our own Body.\nBut 'tis Objected, That though this be true, it does not appear that\nlaying a Duty on their Goods here can be a Burthen or Ruin to\ntheir trade, it being rais'd here not there, and paid by the Importer,\nand to him again by the Retailer, and at last by the Consumer,\nin the Prices of the Goods; all Taxes in general being supposed\nto be paid by the last Buyer.\nThis were a good Argument, if sad Experience had not made it\nappear to be a mistake; and to convince those who are of another\nOpinion, 'twill be necessary a little to examine the History of the\ntrade, and of the last Duty imposed upon it.\nOur Sugar Trade, in general, is but a young Manufacture, and\ndates its Original within the Memory of some Persons now living,\nand is, perhaps, the greatest improv'd Trade, and the most Profitable\nto England, that is, or ever was in the World. The first\ncause of its rise was from the Indiscretion of the Portuguese, who\npresuming upon their being Masters of the Sugar- Trade in the\nBrasills, laid a heavy Tax on their own Sugar, which encourag'd\nour Island of Barbadoes, to whom first the way of making of Sugar\nwas discover'd, to run into the Trade; and it has been in vain that\nthe Portuguese saw their Error, and have since endeavour'd to retrieve\nit. This is so direct an Example, 'tis needless to argue it.\nAnd whoever knows the Sugar- Trade, cannot be ignorant, that it\nis not impossible to be lost by the same Error by which it was\ngain'd.\nIn the Reign of the late King James an additional Duty was\nlaid upon Sugar, notwithstanding all the Remonstrances of the\nTraders and Planters to the contrary; and yet even then nothing\nbut the pretence that the Duty wou'd not affect the Planters but lye\non the Consumer, with a Promise of His Majesty to remit it if it\nprov'd otherwise, could make it seem tolerable.\nBut when time demonstrated the sad effect it had on the Planter,\nand they applied for Relief, they were answer'd, 'Twas an Unmannerly\nthing to put His Majesty in mind of His Promise.\n'Tis true, if sugar was Planted and Cur'd in England, the Duty\nmight lye on the Consumer, as in other Cases it does; but here the\nCase differs exceedingly.\nThe Planter is the Seller at our Market, the Merchant here is but\nthe Factor; when the Planter Ships his Sugars for England he consigns\nthem to his Factor to be Sold for him, and generally draws\nBills upon his Factor for as much as he supposes the Produce to be,\nand sometimes more.\nUpon laying the Duty abovementioned, the Experiment was made;\nthe Factor had two ways to manage the Sugars and Bills, and no\nmore.\n1. To\n(3)\n1. To Accept the Bills absolutely. Or,\n2. Conditionally.\nIf he accepted the Bills absolutely, he would then sell the Goods\nat the Market-price, let it be what it would, to enable him to\ncomply with the Payment; and if the Produce did not make it\ngood, the Planter remain'd Debtor to the Ballance, so the Loss\nreturn'd upon him.\nIf he accepted the Bills conditionally, that is, to pay when the\nGoods are sold: If the Goods did not sell in time, the Bills went\nback protested, or else were Noted, and lay here at Interest and\nCharges. By both which the Planter was a considerable Loser both\nin Money and Reputation.\nThe Buyers here knowing too well these Methods of their Trade,\nand that of Necessity the Factor must sell for the Reasons aforesaid,\nrefused to advance in Price notwithstanding the Duty, and withheld\nbuying by a General Consent, and the Consequence soon\nanswer'd their Expectation, for the factors were forced to sell at the\nold Price to support the Credit both of themselves and their Principals.\n\nBut some of the most Considerable Factors being willing to try\nall possible Ways for their Employers, shipp'd off great Quantities\nfor Holland, Hambourgh, and other Parts, but those Markets\nbeing not able to take off the Quantities, and the Bills still following\nthe Goods, to enable the Exporter to pay the Planters Bills, as\nabove, the very same thing follow'd Abroad, the Goods were\nforced to be sold to raise the Money, and the Loss fell still upon\nthe poor Planter.\nThus, whoever pays the Money, the Planter bears the Loss, and\nis left in Debt, and consequently Undone; for 'tis quite another\nthing to be in Debt in the West Indies than 'tis in England.\nThat the Planter is not able to bear the Duty, at least, at this\ntime, is the next thing to be proved, and that is as plain as the\nother. The War which has lasted now nine Years, has been a\nGeneral Prejudice to all Trade, but to the West-India Trade in\nparticular: And in the West Indies, the Islands of Barbadoes and\nJamaica have been as it were destin'd to be Ruin'd, having besides\nthe War had a Complication of Disasters, as the dreadful Earthquake,\nand the Insurrection of the Negroes at Jamaica, the Loss of\nThree or Four entire Fleets from Barbadoes, by Disaster of Weather\nand Hurricanes, together with a Distemper brought amongst them\nby the Men of War, little better than the Plague, which sweet\naway great Numbers of their Inhabitants,\nAlso they have raised Forces, and fitted out Ships at their own\nCharge for several Expeditions; and in short, besides their Losses\nat Sea by the French, with the Ruin of great part of Jamaica,\nand St. Christophers, by their Descents, have raised larger Taxes on\ntheir Estates than has been paid by us at home; by which Means\nthere is not half the Sugar planted in the West-Indies that was before\nthe War.\nAfter",
