  "text": "80\nAn ESSAY\nIt was never made out (or indeed pretended)\nbefore that Honourable Committee\nthat those Forts and Castles were\nto wage a National War, or to secure against\na National Invasion, the defence of\ntheir Guns could not exceed their reach,\nwhich was not above a Mile at most; nor\nwere there any Magazines of Provisions\nlaid up to expect a Siege from the Natives;\nneither could they hinder Interlopers\nwho traded on the Coasts of what\nNation soever; but for that end the Company\nhad obtained Frigats from the Government,\nwho by illegal Commissions\ndestroyed our own Merchants Ships (unless\npermitted on the payment of Forty or\nFifty per Cent at home on the Goods they\ncarried out) whilst they let others alone;\nThis being seconded by their factors in\nthe several Plantations, who seized them\nand their Cargoes there if they escaped\nthe former, discouraged our private Traders,\nwho else found no Difficulties, the\nNatives receiving them as Friends, and\nchoosing rather to deal with them than\nthe Company; whose Factories also being\nat remote distances from each other\ngreat part of that Coast was unguarded,\nand untraded too by them.\nNor\non TRADE, &c.\n81\nNor do I see what need there was to\nfight our way into a Trade altogether as\nadvantageous to the Natives as to us, for\nwhilst we supply'd them with things\nthey wanted, and were of value amongst\nthem, we took in exchange Slaves, which\nwere else of little worth to the Proprietors;\nand it cannot be thought that the\nPeople of England who have setled such\nlarge Colonies on the Continent of America\n(besides its several Islands) where\nthere was no reasonable Prospect of Encouragement,\nand have increased their\nNumbers so as to be able to defend their\nfirst Footings without the help of a Company,\nnot only against the Natives where\nthey found any, but likewise against all\nother Nations, should fall short in carrying\non this Trade, which doth at the first view\noffer the Prospect of so great a Profit.\nLet us now consider the Inconveniences\nthat have attended this Monopoly, and\nconsequently the Convenencies which\nwould come to the Nation by digesting\nit into an open and free, tho' a regulated\nCompany; sure if confining the working\nin a Golden Mine to one day in a week\nwhich would afford the like Treasure everyday\nto the Nation cannot be its advantage,\nno more can the limiting this Trade; for\nif",
