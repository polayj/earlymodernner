Skim it carefully.\nTo five Gallons of Water put ten Ounces of\nwhite Marle, Tobacco Pipe Clay, or other white Bolar\nEarth: if you have not any of these, ten Ounces of\nFuller's Earth. Let it be previously powdered, and\nwell mixed with the Water. Stir this in as the Lime\nand Water were directed to be; increase the Heat to\n160.

For fear of\nburning, you may throw a Gallon into each Copper\nhung to the same Fire, but after let your Liquor run\ninto the first Copper: when full, by means of the\nGroove it will fill the second; and so on to the last\nCopper; when all are full let a small stream run into\nthe first Copper just sufficient to equal the Evaporation\nand keep them all full.
