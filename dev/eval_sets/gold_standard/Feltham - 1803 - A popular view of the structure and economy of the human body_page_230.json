In a new-born infant the pulse-is\nabout 134 in a minute; in middle age from 60\nto 80; in extreme old age from 50 to 24. In\nGreenland, the body is exposed, during long\nwinters, to such cold, that the pulse is reduced\nto 40 or 50 strokes in a minute.\nTo the circulation of the blood, rightly and\nequally performed, we are indebted for life,\nhealth, and at last gradual decay. But if by any\nmeans the blood in its rotatory motion should be\nimpeded or disturbed, it will become the fruitful\ncause of diseases and death. So long as the blood\nand humours of the body are in circulation, life\n* The pulse is not affected by electricity, unless by the impulse\nof shocks, or the irritation of sparks; yet Cavallo and\nothers have asserted to the contrary; but later and more accurate\nexperiments have decided that the pulse is not in the least\ninfluenced either by negative or positive electricity.
