Peter and John?\ntruly the text is not clear in that particular,\nonlie the text saith thus much, they laid on their\nhands on the Samaritans, they, in the plurall\nnumber. I shall say no more as to these circumstances,\nI hope those which are judicious\nwill not stand upon such niceties as these are,\nbut rather will mind substantials; and so I shall\ndesire the Reader to make his progresse unto\nthe next particular, and leave this unto\nconsideration.\nCHAP.
